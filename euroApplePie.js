      "In a large bowl, combine the flour, 100g of granulated sugar, and salt. Add the chilled butter and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add cold water and mix until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half, wrap each half in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.",
      "Preheat the oven to 200째C (390째F).",
      "In a large bowl, combine the apples, lemon juice, brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Mix well and set aside.",
      "On a lightly floured surface, roll out one half of the dough to a 30 cm (12-inch) circle. Transfer the dough to a 24 cm (9.5-inch) pie dish. Trim the excess dough, leaving a 2 cm (1-inch) overhang.",
      "Fill the pie crust with the apple mixture.",
      "Roll out the second half of the dough to a 30 cm (12-inch) circle. Place it over the apple filling. Trim the excess dough, leaving a 2 cm (1-inch) overhang. Fold the top crust under the bottom crust and pinch the edges to seal. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.",
      "Sprinkle the remaining 50g of granulated sugar over the top crust.",
      "Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Then, reduce the temperature to 180째C (350째F) and continue baking for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the edges of the crust start to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil.",
      "Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before serving. This will allow the filling to set and make it easier to slice.",
      "Serve the European Apple Pie warm or at room temperature with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream, if desired."
