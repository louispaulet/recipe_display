      "Add the cognac to the skillet and carefully ignite it with a long match or lighter. Allow the flames to die down, then add the white wine and fish stock. Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce the heat, letting it simmer for 10-15 minutes until reduced by half.",
      "Stir in the heavy cream and continue to simmer the sauce for another 5-7 minutes, or until it thickens slightly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
  "In a small bowl, whisk together the Dijon mustard and egg yolks. Slowly add a small amount of the hot sauce to the egg mixture to temper it. Gradually whisk the tempered egg mixture back into the sauce.",
  "Gently fold the lobster meat and chopped tarragon into the sauce.",
  "Place the reserved lobster shells in a shallow baking dish, and spoon the lobster and sauce mixture into the shells.",
  "In a separate pan, melt the remaining 30 grams of butter and mix it with the grated Gruyère cheese. Sprinkle the cheese mixture evenly over the lobster-filled shells.",
  "Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden brown.",
  "Serve the Lobster Thermidor immediately with crusty bread, a green salad, and a glass of fine white wine. Enjoy this extravagant and indulgent French classic."

"notes": [
  "To make this recipe even more luxurious, consider adding a few slices of black truffle to the sauce.",
  "To ensure the lobster remains tender, avoid overcooking it during the initial boiling step.",
  "If you cannot find Gruyère cheese, you can substitute it with a high-quality Swiss or Comté cheese."
